# Python 3 - Scripts

# A python scripts is basically just a text file in which you input your Python code in order to build larger applications

# Since the Pyton Interpreter is suitable for small tasks and chunks of code only,Python scrips allow you to build programs having hunderds or thousands of lines of codes, make changes to your code and run it as many times as you want

# The main thing you have to remembr here is that each python file/script must have the ".py" extention

# Lets write our first python script

# For this we are going to use a Python function that does nothing more than to just print the characters in between its parentheses to the screen.

print("Greetings Everyone!!!")

# Next - User input
