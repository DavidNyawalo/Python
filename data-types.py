# Python 3 - Data Types

# Lets see what types of data can be stored in memory and used inside Python Applications.

# The Python Programming Language defines many types of data for many types of operations. We will at most widely use data types.

# As an overview, lets enumerate the most famous and useful Python 3 data types -> we have
#  1. Strings
#  2.Numbers
#  3.Booleans
#  4.Lists
#  5.Sets 
#  6.Frozensets
#  7.Tuples
#  8.Ranges
#  9.Dictionaries
#  10. None

# All these data types are built-in into the Python Programmiing core and you will se that they are very clearly defined and easy to use.

# One way to classify data types in by whether the objects of a data type can be modified after creation or not -> this is called mutability ir immutability.

# This leads to two kinids of data types
# 1. Mutable data types : which can be modified after creation -> here we can mention, lists,dictionaries and sets.
#  2. Immutable data types ->  here we have, strings, numbers and tuples

a = 2
a = 4
a = 6
print(a)

# Next -> Strings
