#Tuples are another type of sequence in python.

#You can consider tuples as being  immutable lists, meaning their contents cannot be changed by adding, removing or replacing elements.

#Tuples may prove to be useful when you want to store some data in the form of a sequence and keep that data untouchable. However, unlike sets, tuples are ordered collections of non-unique elements, meaning indexes and duplicates are allowed.

#Ok, enough with the theory, let's start to practice and create our first tuple.
#Tuples are enclosed by parathenses and their elements are separated by commas.
